Simulating a single organism ecosystem						

Consider the following scenario: 
A unicellular organism is confined in a 2D square space made of n2 cells. This is represented by a n ⨯ n matrix. There are k food sources scattered around the space.
0 means the space is empty
1 means the organism is at that cell
2 means there is a food source at that cell
You are given an n⨯n matrix with entries 0, 1 and 2 as input. 
In other words we have exactly: 
one “1 entry”
k “2 entries” 
rest (n2 - k - 1) “0 entries” in the matrix. 

Let this unicellular organism have a visual radius of r. i.e. it can see everything within a Manhattan Distance r from it but is blind to any cell outside this range.
This unicellular organism starts initially at the cell ([n/2], [n/2]), where [] represents floor function. 

One iteration consists of one horizontal/vertical (not diagonal) movement of the organism (Note that the organism cannot move outside the borders of the matrix).
Also let this organism move according to the following rules -
If there is no food particle within the range of vision of the organism then move randomly according to the above iteration rules [Left, Right, Up, Down]. 
If there is a food particle within sight then move towards it in the least number of iterations possible. If there are more than one then move towards any of the closest ones.
After the organism moves to the cell with entry 2, it eats the food particle and the matrix entry changes from 2 to 1 while the particle is on the cell and to 0 once the particle leaves that cell.
This process terminates after the organism has made 10000 moves. 

Q) Append the position of the organism after every iteration into a list.
