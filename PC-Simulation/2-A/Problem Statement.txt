Evolution of different organisms:								
Consider the following 2 player game - 
Each player starts with 0 coins and play as per the below rules (Assume having negative coins is allowed) - 

1. In every round they have to pick one of 2 choices, either to cooperate or to cheat. Note that the players don’t know each other's choices.
2. If both players simultaneously choose to cooperate then they both win 2 coins each.
3. If both players simultaneously choose to cheat, they both come out empty-handed.
4. If one player chooses to cooperate while the other cheats then the cheating player wins 3 coins and the cooperating player loses 1 coin.
5. The players play 10 such rounds with each other.

Now consider 3 types of players. Let's name them A, B and C. They play as per the following algorithm 
1. Player A always cheats.
2. Player B always cooperates.
3. Player C cooperates in the first round, then mimics whatever move was played by his opponent in the previous round.

Type X vs Type Y:								
Consider all possible combinations of X and Y and see which Type performs better.
Summarize your findings.
	
Consider a society of 25 people divided into x people of type A, y of type B and z of type C. We consider the following process as “Evolution” for our scenario.

1. Every player plays a game against every other player (players of the same type also play against each other) and we tally up the total coins gained by each player in these games.
2. After everyone is done playing, the 5 players with the least coins gained get eliminated. If there are more than 5 players then 5 of them are chosen at random.
3. The 5 top players are chosen and cloned so there are again exactly 25 total players, cloning preserves type.
4. The process repeats again.

This series of games repeats continuously until only one type of player remains. If only A remains then we say that A has dominated.
